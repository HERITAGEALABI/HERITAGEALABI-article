  <section id="tribute-info"> <blockquote>
There is this attribute about people that makes them judge first. The appearance, manner of communication, body  languages and most importantly the words altered by a fellow. Once these attributes are checked and accessed on the spot, people draw out conclusions. It is either positive or negative, which affects their attitude towards the fellow. Honestly people can be beautiful and also ugly, these qualifications are drawn out from behavioural patterns.
I admire this young lady, Juliana Martins. She is one of the very beautiful people who portray the best attribute.
<p> Juliana Martins was born into a family of three and came out cute and healthy. She is the baby of the house and daddy's queen. Everyone loved the quiet child while growing up. She turned out to  be this beautiful lady. Miss Juliana here started here journey way back in tech. She started from the basis of web; HTML, CSS, Little Script then dived into UI/UX. Learned about the user's preference and mood with colours, images and animation.
   <br> On the long run, she discovered her passion for writing and she disliked writing codes. This young lady here expresses writing in beautiful patterns. She inspires so much that i look up to her all the time. She is so passionate about learning grooming herself that she started coming out on social media and started making the right connection.</p>Juliana here remains the person i admire a lot
